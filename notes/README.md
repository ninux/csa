# Notes
---
The following links provide minimalistic code examples for various
topics. The idea is to use these to
* repeat essential mechanisms of C#
* catch their essence in a selfmade minimalistic example
* discuss the examples with other students

## Topics

* [using base constructors](./base_constructor.md)
* [inheritance basics](./inheritance.md)
